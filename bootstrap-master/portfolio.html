        <h1>PORTFOLIO</h1>
    
       <p>I have successfully completed undergrad project and graduate project.I would like to share few of my project and my experience that i obtained.I used best of my knowledge to make them work successfully. Some of my projects are in team and some i have done individually. In both case i learnt how to handle project  when we are doing on our own and in group. </p>
       <p>Many times when i was doing my projects individually, i have seen my self having good confident on my work and making my project successful. on other hand, working in team has always bought knowledge sharing opportunity.Working with people from different diversity of region not only allowed me to share and discuss our project details but it also allowed me to expose to different culture &amp;language.</p>
       <p>Hence, having experience in both environment, i will be best fit for either working individually or in team. Please find some of my project here to know more about my academic profile.</p>
