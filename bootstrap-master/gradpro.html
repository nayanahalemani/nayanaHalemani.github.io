    <h2>Introduction</h2><br>
    <p>  This project is designed for software engineering development course. The main objective of this project was focusing and implementing it in accordance with waterfall model.</p>
    <p>The game will consist of 3 levels easy, medium, and hard. These difficulty levels will have a pre-determined amount of questions that will be randomized every time the game is played. This type of gaming structure will ensure that if the user plays the game three times in a row that they will not get the same questions three times in a row. Each level’s questions will be worth a certain amount of points. The user has to accumulate a certain number of points before they can advance to the next round. Unbeknownst to them that one of the question will be a hidden bonus that could potentially advance them to the next round without going through the process of answering every question in the round. What makes the game such a great learning tool involves potential incorrect answers, if the user gets a question wrong the correct answer will be shown to them educating them while also telling them to start over. The questions will cover a variety of topics from history, science, geography, and entertainment. The user’s total score will be calculated at the end of the game. They will then have the option of doing better and after so much fun we are certain they will want to do even better the second time playing the

    <h2>System design</h2><br>
    <p> Goal of the project:The Smart Shot Quiz Software is to present a user-oriented multiple-choice quiz program with different topics and different levels</p>
    
    <p> Objectives</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Topics:  4 different topics are available, including history, science, art and literature. </li>
        <li>Difficulty Levels:  for each topic, there are questions at different levels: easy, medium and hard.</li>
        <li>Bonus:  questions will appear randomly, users will get more points if they answer the bonus questions correctly.  </li>
        <li>Quiz modes: Exam mode with time limits, users are required to submit the answer before time- and Casual mode, the time limits are removed.</li>
        <li> Privacy and easy access: the software allows the user to create an account so his/her quiz results won’t be shared with other users. For users who want to start a quick quiz without logging on or registration, a quick start quiz feature is also available</li>
        <li>Status review: during the quiz, the user can check the quiz status, including the answered questions, correct answers and accumulated scores.</li>
        <li>Progress storage: the software has a progress saving functionality; user can save the current quiz and continue later on.</li>
        <li>User feedback.</li>
    </ol><br><hr>
    
    
    <h2>Testing &amp; Results</h2><br>
    <p>TAll the units developed in the implementation phase are integrated into a system after testing of each unit. Post integration the entire system is tested for any faults and failures. <a href="finalppt.pdf">Click here to find some screen shots.</a></p><br> <hr>
